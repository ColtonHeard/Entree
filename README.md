# Entree
Ingredient Recognition App

Food plays a large part in our lives and in a lot of our thoughts. Whether it be what kind of food we're eating or nutritional information, it's a topic that crosses many people's minds daily. Our app would help those that are curious about what to do with their ingredients or want a rough estimate on nutritional information to both find dishes they can make with what they have and get an idea for their nutritional budgets when that information is otherwise unavailable.

Use the app by taking a picture from your camera or by selecting an image from your local gallery. The app and it's AI will then recognize the ingredients in your image and output a host of helpful information such as nutritional information, recipes, and price estimations. This data can be interacted with from their own views and expanded for further detail.
